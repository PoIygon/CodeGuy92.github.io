# LankyBox01
Hello! This is my main personal website. I use it for testing purposes & other useful stuff. If you ever see me doing commits on this repository, it's probably just me fooling around and adding useless stuff to the main website. Feel free to open an issue or a pull request if you want to request a new feature, or if you find a bug in my website :P

## Projects
In my free time, i create some random projects that have no use but are still pretty cool.
