Hello! This is my main personal website. I use it for testing purposes & other useful stuff. If you ever see me doing commits on this repository, it's probably just me fooling around and adding useless stuff to the main website. Feel free to open an issue or a pull request if you want to request a new feature, or if you find a bug in my website :P

If you would like to contribute to this repository, then feel free to create a pull request! If i merge it, your name will be written in the Credits section.
